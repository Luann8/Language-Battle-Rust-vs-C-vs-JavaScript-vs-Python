    <h1>Comparison of Programming Languages</h1>

<p>Programming languages are essential tools for developers, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore the characteristics of some popular programming languages:</p>

<h2>Rust</h2>
    <p>Rust is a systems programming language known for its emphasis on safety and performance. It provides memory safety without sacrificing speed, making it suitable for projects where reliability and efficiency are crucial.</p>
    <h2>C</h2>
    <p>C is a powerful and versatile language widely used for system programming and embedded systems. It offers low-level control over hardware resources, making it ideal for projects that require direct interaction with hardware.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language commonly used for web development. It runs on the client side in web browsers, enabling interactive and dynamic user experiences. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript is also used for server-side development.</p>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Python's extensive standard library and ecosystem of third-party packages make it a versatile choice for developers.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Each programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on the specific requirements of the project. Whether you prioritize performance, safety, ease of use, or community support, there is a programming language that suits your needs.</p>
